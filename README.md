Introduction
------------

This repository contains some example of usage
Neural Networks for simple tasks, like spellcheking,
classification of text messages and images.


Description
-----------

Each solution placed in a separate folder:

 * spell_checker_library - is a library which we use to
   correct text before clasterization of classification.
   The correct text classification is more effective.

 * spellchecker2.0 - simple script which demonstrates
   how simple spellchecker works. Run it two times to 
   see the results.
