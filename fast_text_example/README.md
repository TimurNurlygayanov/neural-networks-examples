Introduction
------------

This is very simple example of how to use
Gensim library and FastText model to check
the similarity of different strings.

Note: the strings can be large.

How To Install Requirements
---------------------------
To install requirements just run the following commands:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
And then run in your Python interpretator:

    import nltk
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    
So, you have to execute this code once to be able to use default stop words for english texts.

How To Run
----------

To run the code just execute the following command:

    python3 check_similarity_of_strings.py
